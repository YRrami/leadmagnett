    headline: "ðŸš€ How Austin Jumping Castles Turned $3K/Month Into $85K in Sales",
    before: "Austin Jumping Castles is a family-run business offering inflatable fun across Sydney. Despite a great service and positive customer feedback, they were struggling to scale. They were relying on word of mouth and had tried advertising before â€” but with little return.",
    challenge: "Their biggest challenge was predictability. Some weeks were fully booked; others were completely dry. They had no clear system to consistently bring in bookings, especially during off-peak seasons.",
    solution: "We built a targeted Google Ads campaign focused on high-intent keywords in their area â€” including suburb-specific search terms and seasonal event targeting. We created landing pages that were optimized for conversion, structured call tracking, and implemented dayparting strategies to make sure ads showed when customers were searching.",
    result: "In just 60 days, Austin Jumping Castles scaled from inconsistent leads to consistent bookings and $85,000/month in sales â€” all on a $3,000/month ad budget.",
    bonus: "Theyâ€™ve now expanded their fleet and are considering launching new party rental services due to increased demand.",

    headline: "ðŸš— How a Sydney Towing Company Went From Slow Days to 25+ Calls Daily",
    before: "This towing company was operating across Sydney but wasnâ€™t getting consistent business. They relied on an outdated website and organic search, which was too slow to deliver results. Their competitors were dominating the paid search space.",
    challenge: "They needed urgent calls â€” not clicks or form submissions. Tow truck customers are in the moment of need. This required a strategy that didnâ€™t just generate leads â€” it had to deliver live phone calls at scale.",
    solution: "We crafted a location-based Google Ads campaign targeting 'tow truck near me' and emergency-related terms. We used call-only ads during peak traffic hours and set up a 24/7 tracking system with instant response automation to capture every possible call.",
    result: "With just a $4,500/month ad spend, they now receive 25+ calls every single day â€” and the cost per call is well below industry average.",
    bonus: "Theyâ€™ve added three new trucks to keep up with the increased demand and are now planning to open a second location.",
  },
  {
    headline: "ðŸŒ± How a Dubai Hair Brand Hit 8X ROAS in 45 Days",
    before: "Ultra Green Life, a clean beauty brand based in Dubai, was ready to growâ€”but their Meta ads werenâ€™t profitable. Their products were top-tier, but poor targeting and generic creatives held them back from scale.",
    challenge: "They needed a performance strategy that could cut through a saturated beauty market and deliver measurable ROI, not vanity metrics.",
    solution: "We built a full-funnel Meta strategy â€” starting with high-converting video ads tailored to GCC culture and beauty trends. We segmented audiences by lookalike data, retargeted based on pixel events, and tested dozens of creative variations.",
    result: "Ultra Green Life scaled to 8X ROAS in just 45 days â€” doubling monthly revenue while lowering cost-per-purchase by 37%.",
    bonus: "They're now preparing to launch in Saudi Arabia, with us leading the expansion plan.",
  },
  {
    headline: "ðŸ˜Ž How Vibe Haus Turned TikTok Glasses Into a 12X ROAS Winner",
    before: "Vibe Haus had a fun productâ€”party glasses with built-in lens filtersâ€”but no real traction. Their previous agency focused on impressions and likes, not revenue. Sales were unpredictable and mostly organic.",
    challenge: "They needed a system to turn viral moments into real purchases â€” consistently.",
    solution: "We rebuilt their Meta strategy from scratch, focusing on bold, trend-driven UGC paired with direct-response copywriting. We implemented a conversion-focused Shopify funnel, connected CAPI, and built retargeting sequences that hit at the right moment.",
    result: "Vibe Haus hit 12X ROAS in under 30 days and turned into a top seller in their niche. Their average daily orders tripled and the brand became a go-to for party accessories.",
    bonus: "They just launched a new collection â€” GlowRush â€” and itâ€™s already outperforming the original product line.",
